# CelciusAndFahrenheit_AI
This is my first time using and understanding AI using Python
It is no necesary to use for solve this problem using just classic programming this would be solved but thats why i chose this problem. SIMPLICITY

Also you can solve any linear problem with this AI algorithm
But, you can not do things like polynomial regression. 

## 1-1 Neurons
This problem is very simple so we dont need hidden layers but... i will experiment a little bit with this.
So in other branches or in the same u can find other files with the same algorithm but with layers

## Traditional Programming

This is a extremely easy formula to code that is why i chose it to start with AI
